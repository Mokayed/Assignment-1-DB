Assignment 1 - Simple DB with Hashmap-based Index
Hello

Just run the main.
Add data by calling setData methode from StoreReadData class.
Read the data from the file by typing the ID number of the country that u added to the file after running the main.


What i could do better....
Check if the key if it is already been used in the file.
Make a error message if the program didnt find the data the user searching for....
